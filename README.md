#### Output:

Besides, at the end of the output the user will be asked whether he or she wants to load and display 5 rows of the filtered data. Should the user choose so, 5 rows of data will be displayed until the user chooses not to (typing 'no').
After that, the user can either restart the query or quit the application.

### Files used
* Chicago bike share data (chicago.csv)
